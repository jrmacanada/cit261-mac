    <h4>Transcript:</h4>
    <p>Hello, my name is Michael Cavey. I hope you enjoy my site. I hope you will learn what makes the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
        Saints a uniquely and truly Christian institution. This Church was created by Christ and is the restoration and fulfillment of the 
        Gospel. It was born out of revelation to prophets and continues to receive revelation from Christ to the living prophets of His Church.</p>
    <p>This happens by the power and gift of the Holy Ghost through the priesthood of God and Christ. When Joseph Smith, the prophet of the 
        Restoration, was asked what makes the church unique among the many other denominations, he said, “We have the Holy Ghost”. The Holy 
        Ghost is the Revelator with direction from Christ.</p>
    <p>The concept of living revelation is easier to accept once you have received it. I have received personal revelation from God regarding 
        the salvation of my soul. God has made Himself known to me through His Spirit. I know that the forgiveness Christ gained for us is real. 
        I know His Spirit turned my heart and guided my journey into this Church.</p>
    <p>My hope for you is that as you investigate the truth that we have, you too will come to know God through His Spirit. If you are so 
        blessed as to have your faith proved, your life will change because you will no longer have doubt. You will know what the Saints 
        know, namely, that He Lives! Your newfound knowledge will bring you to repentance and lead you to the baptismal font of His Church. </p>
    <p>So please, take the time to learn. This web site is a primer to the vast stores of gospel truth published by the Church of Jesus Christ 
        of Latter-day Saints. Ponder and pray; read and enjoy His gospel of salvation and exaltation. Our Father in Heaven wants you back.</p>
