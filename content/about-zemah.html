    <h4>Transcript:</h4>
    <p>Zemah is a biblical character of messianic significance. The Old Testament prophet Zechariah speaks of him as a servant of our Lord. 
        The Hebrew translation of Zemah means “the branch” or “vegetation”. In the New Testament gospel of John, converts to Christ are spoken 
        of as the branches of the True Vine.</p>
    <p>Zemah is the convert’s name of a historical figure named Zerubbabel, who was the governor of the Jewish people in exile in Babylon 
        after that city fell to the Persian Empire of King Cyrus. During the reign of King Cyrus, Zerubbabel and the people of Judah were 
        allowed to leave Babylon to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple in preparation of Christ’s birth, ministry, atonement, and 
        His resurrection.</p>
    <p>This web site takes its name and its cause from this story of God’s chosen people making that journey out of Babylon and back to the 
        promised land because today we too must leave the captivity of our modern Babylon of material lusts and be converted to Christ. Our 
        faith must be a journey of learning converted to action toward rebuilding the spiritual temple within and then in worthiness we can 
        enter into a Temple of our Lord, rebuilt in our day by the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Such a journey will 
        number us with the saints of God and plant us firmly in the gospel sod of an Israel built in Christ.</p>
